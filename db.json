      "reviewDescription": "This is my very first Apple device, my initial thoughts are:I am very impressed by the hardware of this device. Specifically:- A quick CPU benchmark placed this at around 90% of my desktops performance (Ryzen 9 9800X3D). For a laptop, that is absolutely unheard of.- The battery seems to last forever, even with semi-intensive workloads. At one point I used it for an hour and still had 97% battery.- The display is incredible. The contrast, resolution, and refresh rate combined make this about the best I've seen.- The webcam is high quality.- The MagSafe charger is very niceIn general, Macs don't support as much software as Windows. In my case, it does support everything I would need a laptop for, but it is something to keep in mind.However, because Apple has their own OS, hardware, etc, the software experience is far more tailored to the device than Windows devices are. As an example, the webcam settings are very easy to use and access.The device itself is very light and thin, it was a little smaller than I expected, ordering the 14 inch one, but I don't have any issues with it.In conclusion: This is a premium laptop, for a premium price - designed with ease of use and workloads in mind.",

      "reviewDescription": "The MacBook Pro M4 14-inch is hands-down one of the fastest, smoothest laptops I’ve ever used. Everything from boot-up to heavy multitasking is incredibly quick and responsive. Apps launch instantly, video editing is seamless, and battery life is excellent — I can go a full day without needing to plug in.The screen is gorgeous, speakers are rich and clear, and the keyboard/trackpad combo is still the best in the game. It feels like a true professional machine in a compact body.✅ What I Love:• Blazing fast performance with the new M4 chip• Beautiful 14” Liquid Retina XDR display• Long-lasting battery• Solid build quality — feels premium and sturdy• Quiet and cool under load⚠️ Minor Concern:I went with the black (Space Black) finish, which looks amazing out of the box — but it picks up fingerprints and smudges easily. Even with clean hands, I find myself constantly wiping it down to keep it looking clean. It doesn’t affect performance at all, but something to be aware of if you’re picky about aesthetics.⸻💬 Final Verdict:If you want a powerful, premium laptop for work, creativity, or everyday use, the MacBook Pro M4 14” is an absolute beast. Just be ready to give the black finish a little extra care — or consider using a case or skin if that kind of thing bothers you.",

      "reviewDescription": "As a developer, performance, reliability, and efficiency are non-negotiable. After upgrading to the MacBook Pro with the M4 chip, I can confidently say: this is the best Mac you can get if you're a developer like me.The jump in speed is noticeable across the board. Whether I'm compiling large projects, running Docker containers, or juggling multiple VS Code windows with Chrome, Postman, and the terminal—everything feels faster and smoother. Thermal management is excellent, meaning I can work in silence without the fans kicking in or the machine heating up under pressure.Battery life is another huge win. I can go through a full workday on a single charge, even with my usual heavy dev workflow.If you're in the Apple ecosystem and you're serious about development—whether it's web, mobile, backend, or even AI/ML—the M4 MacBook Pro is an investment that pays off immediately in productivity and peace of mind.",

      "reviewTitle": "Longest lasting battery I’ve ever seen in a laptop",
      "reviewDescription": "Very fast laptop, very long battery life. For the graphically interesting games natively compatible with it, very good graphics performance. The display is amazing and is capable of twice as many pixels as it shows you. It was a good value in a Black Friday sale (~$1400), but this (M4 Pro 12/16) chip is on par with or under performance of the prior generation M3 Max 14”, so if it can get one of those for a good deal refurbished or open box, there is no shame in it. As with all M1/2/3/4s, there are dedicated neural cores for Apple Intelligence to run, which allows for a personalized Siri who listens to you and watches you all the time, without sharing this information. You can disable Apple Intelligence and Siri, but after I got past the creepiness, I configured Siri as an Irish Female, and it makes everything lovely. There is a lot of integration with other Apple devices, like you can operate your iphone from a distance on your MacBook. You can also receive texts and Messages from your iPhone, and easily use it for tethering, as a substitute for your webcam (the webcam is pretty solid nonetheless). This model supports linking hearing aids and also supports airpods much in the same way the iPhone does. You can easily use your living room TV as a second monitor on the fly, and if you can plug in via HDMI, you can get the whole 4K@120hz. MacOSX is a great operating system, built on Unix, and with tons of room for customization for beginners to super users. Time Machine backups with your own plug-in hard drives and iCloud are incredibly convenient. Safari gets better and better, but the Mac versions of Chromium and Firefox also dazzle.For most programs that aren’t games, macOSX is widely supported, but if you just *need* it, parallels desktop and vmware can run windows for you.New users ought to pay close attention to Tips and go into settings and learn all the trackpad gestures. You won’t want to come back to a different trackpad, and until you want to game, you will not care to use a mouse.Anyway, I got this for my wife as a gift, partly because she needed a new computer and partly because I wanted to convert her. She seems pretty converted.",

From the moment you crack open that iconic box, you’re hit with the kind of premium experience that feels less like unboxing a computer and more like peeling back the cover on a brand-new luxury car. It’s clean. It’s precise. It’s next level.💻 Design & BuildSleek doesn’t even begin to describe it. Apple has mastered minimalism, and this machine is proof. Every inch of the M4 MacBook Pro screams modern sophistication. It’s compact without feeling fragile, with a chassis that feels rock-solid in your hands. You’ll know right away this isn’t a device that compromises.🔊 Audio That Hits DifferentLet’s talk sound — because wow. This isn’t your average tinny laptop audio. The MacBook Pro M4 delivers full, rich, immersive sound that surrounds you like a personal concert hall. Whether you’re streaming, editing, or just zoning out to your favorite playlist, the audio quality alone sets this machine in a class of its own.⚡ PerformanceUnder the hood, the M4 chip goes to work. Everything runs smooth as silk — apps launch instantly, multitasking is a breeze, and even the heaviest workflows barely make it break a sweat. It’s not just fast. It’s scary fast. This is a true powerhouse for creatives, professionals, and anyone who refuses to wait on a loading bar.🖱️ Trackpad & ExperienceThe trackpad? Possibly the best in the business. Responsive, comfortable, and intuitive. It’s one of those things you don’t realize is important until you use it — and then you never want to go back. The entire user experience feels like it was built to anticipate your needs before you even know them.📷 CameraThe camera is chef’s kiss. Crisp, clear, and perfect for video calls or content creation. It’s what you expect from Apple, and they delivered.🍏 Switching from Windows? Read This.If you’re new to Mac, be ready for a shift — but don’t worry, it’s a good one. MacOS is a different ecosystem, and yes, there’s a learning curve. But once you get the hang of it, everything just makes sense. The layout, the shortcuts, the accessibility — it’s like discovering a better way to compute.⸻⭐ Final VerdictOwning a MacBook Pro M4 14” is more than having a computer — it’s joining a legacy of excellence. It’s beautiful, bold, and built to perform. Whether you’re a die-hard Apple fan or a curious Windows convert, this machine delivers an unforgettable experience from the first click to the last.5/5 stars. Worth every penny.",

      "reviewDescription": "Based on the details you provided, here is a draft of a review you can use:A Fantastic Renewed MacBook Air — A True 10/10I wanted to wait a few weeks before writing this review, and I'm so glad I did. The renewed Apple 2025 MacBook Air 15-inch with the M4 chip has been an absolutely phenomenal purchase. The first thing I did was call Amazon to verify the renewal process. The team member I spoke with confirmed that these units are refurbished by Apple, which handles all inspections, part replacements, and quality checks. They pay close attention to cosmetics and put a heavy emphasis on battery life, ensuring every unit meets Apple's high standards.When my MacBook Air arrived, it was in the original packaging, just as the pictures I took show. I was amazed by its condition. The only sign of previous use is an extremely light wear mark on the lower left side of the trackpad, suggesting the last owner was left-handed. The battery came with a full 100% charge and 100% health, which is incredible for a renewed device.This machine is light-years ahead of my old 10-year-old MacBook Air. The M4 chip makes it exceptionally fast, and the 15.3-inch Liquid Retina Display is stunning. Given the amazing quality and performance, especially with upcoming tariffs in mind, I would give this unit at least a 10-star rating if I could. I am completely satisfied with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone.",

Battery life is also amazing — I easily get a full day’s use without needing to charge. The fanless design means it runs silently even under heavy use.Combined with macOS’s stability and Apple’s build quality, this is the best balance of power, portability, and value I’ve seen in a laptop.

I have a great desktop PC computer that I love with dual monitors and it does everything I need but using this for graphic design and photo editing it has been amazing. I did get the 24 gig model with the 512 hard drive and I love it, but I am positive you could’ve got less and did the same. The screen is vibrant and crystal clear, using Adobe Lightroom on here is actually pretty amazing. The one thing I like about the Apple version of a laptop is that it never even hiccups, it never slows down, it never hesitates and it is completely quiet because there are no fans. I would highly recommend this to anybody, it’s a definite win.",

As a student, I needed something portable I can attend lectures and meetings with all day long and this computer delivers in spades. I'm formerly a Windows and Linux user, so trying a MacBook was a leap of faith for me. Glad I did it... it has made my student life significantly easier. It's the perfect size and nice an light. Beautifully designed but not at the cost of function. The Keyboard and Screen are perfect.It will run basic games no problem, but I wouldn't throw any AAA games at it.",

      "reviewDescription": "Great laptop.  Fast, sleek, great operating system.  Needed a basic laptop for average needs.  Debated about getting the ipad with a magic keyboard vs MacBook Air.  The laptop is a far better value.  Real computer, real keyboard,  real operating system and long battery.  If you need a basic computer this is it and so much  more.  If you want something to craze social media get an Ipad.  But I just find this a much better value than an Ipad.  Again you need to assess your needs vs features vs value. If this had a touchscreen I would have not even considered the Ipad.  Face it.  Macbooks are expensive but they hold out a lot better than the other options.  If you are a creative professional you have alot of options when considering RAM and storage options.  But for writing and basic photo editing this is a perfect machine.",

      "reviewTitle": "Very nice piece of tech",
      "reviewDescription": "I would not consider myself an Apple fanboy by any means, but I was looking for a laptop for video editing and general everyday use and this one is perfect for me.It’s paper slim, super light and portable. It’s pretty powerful for what it is, although don’t expect it to run any demanding games at 60+ fps all the time. Since there’s no fan, it uses a passive cooling system by throttling the performance of the laptop as it heats up. So overall not the best option for gaming ( along with the limited library of games available on Mac OS ), although a plus side to having no fan is that there’s no noise.For general use, ( surfing web, watching videos, editing, etc ) It’s great. Runs nice and smoothe. Picture quality is good. The interface of Mac OS is super intuitive. It’s super easy to transfer files between devicesSo far the only thing I despise is the limited ports on the side of the laptop. You have a port for the charging cable, 2 USB-C ports, and a headphone jack, that’s it. This could be fixed by getting a dongle to plug in so you could plug in USB devices and HDMI cables.Overall, i’m happy with it so far. I’m sure this thing will last for a loong time so I think it’s worth it even if it’s pricey.",

      "reviewTitle": "No regrets with this macbook",
      "reviewDescription": "I had a 2014 Macbook Pro and although it still worked great was no longer getting updates. I also wanted to get a Mac that had the M processors but had decided that I wouldn't go with a big screen like last time. I wanted something relatively light. I also wasn't going to spend as much money as last time either. The Macbook Air M4 fit the bill perfectly. I'm using it now for this review. I bought it for $1,049 and I see it's cheaper now but I still have no regrets.Pros:1) This thing is fast! I had built my latest PC with the best components and I'm still finding myself docking this and using it instead2) All of the creative software just seems to work better on this Mac.3) This is the perfect size for portability. I was a little concerned that the screen might be too small given my eyesight but it wasn't a problem. Screen quality is good and I have no issues there.4) Battery life is very good. I'm usually not doing anything power-intensive when I'm just using it as a laptop but I can generally go about a day periodically using it and not have any issues.5) The keyboard is great - not too crowded and the backlighting is good.6) Finally, the base model has 16GB instead of 8GB. I don't know why Apple insisted that 8GB was enough in 2025 - memory is pretty cheap and 16GB is pretty much the minimal you need now a days.Cons1) This is true for all modern macbooks, but you have to absolutely get what you need when you buy it. It's not upgradeable. You can do some things like get a thuderbolt 4/5 ssd enclosure for storage but you have to nail down the amount of RAM you want. However, as I mentioned above the default RAM is 16 GB and that's good enough for most people.2) The magsafe connector is great but it does seem to come off a little too easily. It's a minor gripe at best.Overall just a great laptop - I'm very happy with it.",

It seems much more sturdy as well, so it should survive any unfortunate falls (although I do not plan on having any), and should last me a while yet. The battery life also surprised me (since when do I not need to charge a laptop every 4 hours?!) and it’s actually super lightweight and easy to carry with me for college classes, hobby writing and work. All round, it’s been one of my most expensive but much worth it purchases of the year",

The keyboard feels great to type on and the trackpad is smooth and accurate. The new Sky Blue color looks beautiful in person.The webcam quality is a big improvement and video calls look sharp. I also love the MagSafe charging which is convenient and safe.If I had to point out a downside it would be the limited number of ports, but that is easy to solve with a small adapter.

The laptop is a 'beaut'...so much faster and clearer than Windows 10, and a lot more user friendly.  I was surprised to find that it doesn't have a removable battery (that's how old-school I am.)  If this holds up as well as the 3520 I'll be very happy.",

I have never had problems with this Dell or the last.  The only reason I had to buy a replacement is that the last one got knocked off of the table and the place where you plug it in was damaged.  Yet, we kept rigging it up and it worked for months.  I finally decided to get a new one when it became to difficult to keep charged due to the damage.  The sound quality is amazing and so are the visuals.  It is lightweight, so it is easy to carry around in a laptop bag.  Finally, it is easy to setup and use.  I am a loyal Dell customer now.  The price is very reasonable, so get yours now.  You won't regret it!",

Its lightening fast and the set up was so easy. Everything transferred easily from the older LP. I think I made a very, good purchase, and I hope it last me for several years.",

      "reviewDescription": "This laptop is absolutley perfect for my needs. The i-5 processor is fast enough. It has a good amout of memoy and sizeable hard drive. Dell did a good job on this not loading any third party junk on it. It does come with McAffee which is not junk, but still, Windows own anti-virus is just as good. If there is one thing I would wish it had, was a 1920x1200 disply resolution istead of 1920x1080, but not a deal breaker. For the cost, this laptop is way more than you could bargain for.",

Super lightweight, faster than I was expecting for it's specs and the touchscreen is a bonus. Had a power outage already to put it to the test. Had multiple tabs open, music running and Office tasks and after the 4.5hour outage still had 88% battery.Note, I do not think you could easily upgrade the ram or m2 drive or replace the battery as the unit is sealed. There is no consumer way to access the inside without removing OEM stickers and casing that would surely void any warranty so keep that in mind.For a backup device that's very portable, and fast cant beat the price.",

      "reviewDescription": "I just graduated high school and got this laptop to use for college — and so far, I really love it!  The setup took about an hour (mostly due to downloads), but it was super easy overall. The touchscreen is such a fun and useful feature — I honestly didn’t expect to love it this much! The big screen is another plus — everything looks super clear and easy to read, which makes using on it really enjoyable.The fan used to turn on for a minute and then turn off, but recently it hasn’t done that at all, still a little skeptical of it cuz lowk it’d be awkward if I’m taking an exam and everyone’s quiet and it turns on 😭 hopefully that won’t happen… Uhm anyways! haven’t used it in class yet since I just bought it during summer, but I start college next month and it definitely feels like it’ll handle everything I need. For around $400, it feels like a total bang for your buck, and I’m happy with it so far.I really hope this laptop sticks with me through all my college years! Wish me luck :)",

      "reviewDescription": "Blazing fast, powerful CPU and graphics card, plenty of RAM and disk space, and so much more! I absolutely love my new laptop! It is fast, easy to setup and get fully updated, and runs games better than my desktop does!I purchased the laptop during Amazon's Prime day as a little bit of a splurge. My previous laptop was nearly 10 years old and was really showing it's age, so it was time for a replacement.I will mention a few items that I'm less than pleased with. First is the number pad that overlays on the mouse pad. This is just a bad idea all around. Sometimes I press the Num Lock button on accident and when that happens the mouse pad stops working as a mouse. Plus, when I have a Bluetooth keyboard attached and activate the Num Lock, it actives the one on the mouse pad as well.Second, unlike other laptops of this price range, it only came with Windows 11 Home edition instead of Pro edition. So I had to pay to upgrade it as I prefer the Pro version as I have more control over the configuration of Windows itself.Last, I wish the display was a touchscreen display. But alas, it was not included with this version.But, all-in-all, I am pleased with the performance, quality, and appearance of this laptop. My hope is that this laptop will provide me with years of use and enjoyment! So far, it's off to a great start!",

      "reviewDescription": "Been using this for a little over a week now, the RTX 5060 performs superb! The screen is beautiful! Especially for being a laptop screen compared to an OLED display or monitor, it looks GREAT, the colors and overall image are very sharp lookingAll of my games( AAA titles or otherwise) run at high or ultra settings with high frame rates and no stutter! Going to be upgrading ram and storage down the lineRuns GTA V Enhanced on High RT over 100fps in most scenariosI’ve also run Warframe with the “high preset” and runs over 120fpsit looks beautiful and performs beautiful! I’m very picky when it comes to frame rate/graphics(coming from an avid desktop user…I have high expectations)and this laptop performs as good or better than it looks! I’m impressedThe speakers aren’t super impressive, and aren’t super loud or anything I wish they were a little better, but they’re not terrible by any means, just not super LOUD, most gamers would probably be using a headset anyway for voice chat/streaming/gameplay anyway…don’t let this steer you away, this is a great laptop despite not having “the best sound system in the world”I Don’t notice any excessive fan noise or overheating issues of any kindI’m using it everyday for gaming and I can’t leave it alone! When I have lan parties at friends houses, my trusty machine comes with me!I’m always excited to open the lid, plug it in and start gaming! The RGB lighting is gorgeous! It’s also fun to show off to friends and family ;)I’ve owned many gaming laptops over the last 12 years or so, this is my second machine with an 5060 in it,  and this one has been my favorite!  Better than any of the rest!",

      "reviewDescription": "Have not had it long, not really a hardcore gamer, mostly play WoT, which this is overkill for. I do like the RGB, though the keyboard isn't the easiest to ready(prefer the keyboard on my MSI thin 15, much easier to see for these old eyes). I use a separate mouse/KB combo so that negates the laptops kb issue for me. Everything else with this Asus is far superior to the MSI. Ease of access to upgrade drive and memory is the major perk with this Asus, it's a breeze. Added a Samsung 990 2tb NVMe.It has a quality feel, it's fast, the price was right. Wifi works great, and so far no heating issues. Playing WoT probably isn't push it much, but it's sitting on a Klim turbo frost cooling pad, mainly for having filtered air entering the laptop. The laptop fits this cooling pad perfectly and it's not noisy at all. No issues holding up to my TV using HDMI to get a nice big picture while blowing up tanks.",

The setup was quick and simple, and it runs fast with no lag for web browsing, streaming, and everyday tasks. The battery life is excellent—I can go most of the day without recharging. The screen is bright and clear, and the keyboard is comfortable to type on. For the price, it’s an amazing value and perfect for work, school, or travel. Highly recommend!",

      "reviewDescription": "I bought this computer as a backup for my work, and I love it. The battery lasts all day while I am working. I love the build quality. Unlike my previous laptops, this does not have holes that allow it to cool at the bottom; these are above the keyboard instead. This is great because I never experience overheating if I place my computer on fabric or plastic which seems to block the holes on other systems I've owned.This is not a touch screen computer, and the keyboard is not backlit either, but these were not among my list of requirements. After owning this for a year, the screen opens and closes nicely. It is neither too slack nor too tight. Additionally, since it has a long hinge that connects the top to the bottom from side to side, the hinge is less likely to break.I love this system and highly recommend it.",

Mediante alimentatore per ricarica rapida si potrà effettuare una carica completa in circa 2 ore.Acquistando a parte una Lenovo pen 2 il display potrà essere utilizzato anche per prendere appunti o disegnare con buona precisione e per un utilizzo basic, certo non è paragonabile ai top di gamma ma molto superiore ai pari fascia di prezzo.Questo Tab11 collegato ad una tastiera e mouse bluetooth permette di lavorare fluidamente con programmi di scrittura.Utilizzato con videogiochi pesanti si potrà giocare solo a dettagli medi, mentre con i titoli leggeri va molto meglio, anche in esterno sotto la luce del sole peccato che il trattamento oleofobico non sia dei migliori (rimangono facilmente le ditate sullo schermo).Il display è comunque uno dei punti forza di questo Tablet ed è possibile modificare i vari parametri (es. temperatura colore) entrando nelle impostazioni, così come i 4 speaker dolby atmos.Attraverso l'app pre-installata “Dolby Atmos” sarà possibile equalizzare il suono a piacimento e in base alla scena (film, musica, giochi ecc).Su questo Tablet oltre al sistema principale Android 10 troviamo diversi programmi preinstallati pronti per un uso ottimale ma stranamente per l’archivio fotografico manca un’app di galleria di default.UTILIZZOIn mano risulta piacevole al tatto e sicuro grazie alle compatte dimensioni e all’elegante design,adatto per tutti coloro che utilizzano il tablet come uno smartphone per scrivere, navigare e chattare con le principali app.Facile e intuitivo il menù, ottima e personalizzabile (es. in dimensioni, posizione ecc…) la gestione del tastierino, così come chiaro, reattivo e ben leggibile è l’ampio e luminoso display.CONCLUSIONIQuesto tablet con un design pulito e perfettamente portatile, è idoneo per tutti coloro che hanno necessità di un dispositivo classico per scrivere, disegnare, navigare, chattare ecc….Ottima autonomia e audio potente, oltre che prestazioni equilibrate.Eccellente il rapporto qualità prezzo, utilissimo per un uso studentesco, universitario, per fare lavori con i programmi di scrittura collegandosi ad un mouse e ad una tastiera.Spero che questa mia esperienza possa esservi utile nella scelta.",

Las apps van de fábula y los videos se reproducen en una calidad inmejorable. Tiene 4 altavoces, 2 en cada lado. Uno arriba y otro abajo por lo que al sujetarla nunca te quedas con el altavoz tapado ya que tienes otro arriba sin bloquear. El sonido es muy nítido y de calidad. El grosor de la tablet podéis compararlo con el de mi dedo indice. Es muy finita y bonita. La recomendaría a cualquier familiar o amigo.",

      "reviewDescription": "At first I was a lot skeptical of this \"laptop\" as it boasts that it is a \"Chromebook killer\" in many reviews.  Having read many reviews on many different Chromebooks, weighed the functionality between this book and the Chromebook, I ultimately chose the HP Stream 11\".As a student, I am oftentimes not online when I am doing my schoolwork during downtime at work, I needed a machine that was lightweight, able to perform the same functions as my laptop but smaller and easier to carry.  I have had this machine for 2 days, and I have fallen in love.Here are some things I have noticed in the short time:-While small, the keyboard is almost the same size as my 15in laptop and the keys are easy to adjust to.-The screen is bright and I don't have to have the brightness turned all the way up in order to view comfortably.  I have seen mixed reviews on this issue, but I dont see the problem-Not laggy.  I haven't noticed any lag, at all.  While setting the machine up I was downloading and installing windows updates, installing a mouse driver, installing Norton Security and office 365 (which was included free) and the machine never skipped a beat.  I was able to do everything in a couple of hours, even setting up the OneDrive storage to make my laptop files available to this machine.  I was impressed that even running Chrome (which can be a memory hog) I have several tabs open at a time and no changes.-At this moment, I have 2 word documents open, 3 chrome tabs open and an additional tab open with youtube and I pulled up a movie purchased through Google, not a hiccup.  Played flawlessly at full screen with no problems.-I haven't tested the SD card capability, however I currently have a 32gig USB flash drive in and it is working fine (I had read some reviews that the machine would only read 16gigs of removable media)-Fanless.  I can sit this thing anywhere with no fear of overheating or burning my legs.  It has been running for 5 solid hours with very little warmth from the bottom.  Also, quieter.-Speakers sound good.  I was able to hear my school lecture clearly over the road noise while driving (no I wasn't operating my laptop while driving, I turned it on, set it in the passenger seat and went)  Even through the youtube channel, I was able to hear my movie clearly and the sound isn't up much at all.-I was able to install printer drivers.  Yes I know, it is 2015, cloud servers, Bluetooth printers, etc... I still have an old school printer, and I have to plug it in and I experienced no problems.Things I am not so hot about:-The box I received from amazon had obviously been opened and someone had this machine prior to me.  They fixed it, but it still grated my nerves a bit.  I expected better.-The mouse.  Call me old fashioned, call me whatever but this mouse is set to the lightest sensitivity and sometimes doesn't register my taps... only happened a couple of times, might be a PEBKAC error... more on this later.-Hard Drive. I understand, it's supposed to be a lightweight, functional, blah blah blah windows version of a Chromebook.  But windows holds most of the hard drive and after installing office, updates, norton and other drivers, I am left with only 6g.  I can save to my USB, but still, maybe up the HD to 64g or 2 smaller HDs equalling a larger amount.  I just feel so limited in that aspect.-I keep hitting CAPS lock.  ugh.-Google offers 2 years of storage ranging from 100gb to 200gb; MS went with 1TB of storage but for only a year.  Not so pleased with that, will be purchasing a MyCloud in the future anyways, but I would rather a longer use of storage.-I have yet to receive 7 or 8 or however many hours of battery life they say this offers.  The most I have seen from the battery meter is 5 hours when I am using it, tested that tonight, went ahead and plugged in after 5, and I am using the recommended settings from HP.-FN (function) keys are backward.  When I would normally hit fn then the sound, or display, and not have to hit anything just to f5 or alt-f4, I have to hit the fn key to use any f-key... just taking some getting used to.-Chrome is a memory hog, it's getting annoying actually, I have the same issue on my laptopThings that make me LOL at other reviewers:-If you are using an online storage system and don't want to use the memory on your machine, you have to make sure that are aren't keeping the files available offline.  If you keep them offline, then you are essentially saving 2 copies and using both your online storage and hard drive.-I read several reviews where people blamed the machine for viruses.... seriously?The main reason I chose this over a chromebook...-Functionality.  As a student, I need MS Office, access to my printer and a machine that will work when offline.  Chromebook didn't seem to offer that.All in all, i am pretty pleased with my purchase. Will be back to update if necessary =)",

      "reviewDescription": "I purchased this computer as a replacement for my 4.5 year old macbook which died suddenly.Pros: I like the pink color. The laptop is very light and it was very easy to set up.Cons: Overall, I am very disappointed with this product. I know that I shouldn't have expected that much from a computer that cost under $200. The computer also lived up to expectations (... complaints) that I had heard from others regarding HP.It was very difficult to do anything on the computer without it slowing down. I bought an extra memory card but it did not seem to make a difference. Windows 8 was not the best, and anytime I tried to multitask or had too many browser tabs open, it slowed down immensely and told me that memory use was low.Aside from the computer itself, I was very dissatisfied with the customer service from HP. About 9 months after purchasing the computer, I had an issue where the screen started blacking out and the machine would shut off, but still indicate it was charging. After attempting to contact HP for over 15 minutes on the phone, I was informed that even though my computer was under warranty, I would have to pay for shipping (and by shipping they meant that I had to pay them to send me a box that I would send back to them). I did that and a few weeks later received a call telling me that my computer issues were not covered under the warranty, but that I could pay to have them shipped. The caller did not give me his name or phone number, and of course we were disconnected. A few days later, I received my broken laptop back in the mail. The entire customer service experience was awful and something I did not experience with Apple or Toshiba (my prior computers).Overall, I would not recommend this computer. Pay a little more and don't get HP!",

Overall, it was a good price, fits my simple needs and I love the colour.Like other netbooks/streambooks/etc that are meant to use cloud/internet based storage - there is very little memory in which to store pictures/docs/music/etc. And, for not having a lot of storage, it comes pre-loaded with a TON of crapware (That I chose to remove to get 5-6 gigs back). Also, the track pad / mouse pad is a little frustrating (inaccurate tracking, right-click non-existent  and you have to hard click in order for it to respond) - I  chose to pick up a small cheap usb mouse to use instead (so much better).Again, fits my needs, style and price range so I'm happy.",

But for that price (259$) i mean you get what you pay for : a good budget laptop.

      "reviewTitle": "SELLER UPGRADED BEYOND CAPACITY VOIDING WARRANTY FROM HP: OVERHEATING + UPDATE",
      "reviewDescription": "DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP. I depend on customer reviews so I carefully researched laptops before ordering. I had this laptop for one week and noticed that the power cord box got very hot. Also, the bottom of the laptop would get unusually warm. One day I left the charger plugged in with the laptop closed. When I opened it, the power would not come on. I unplugged it, kept trying and it eventually came on once cool. I called HP for support and after telling them I had 16 GB RAM, they looked at the upgrades made by the seller and VOIDED MY WARRANTY! Here's the quote from the transcript: \"The computer was originally manufactured with hardware that matched the requirement of this computer, however when I see your computer specifications now, it looks like it has been upgraded by seller beyond its holding capacity and unfortunately this has voided the manufacturing warranty on this computer and due to that we will not be able to provide any support from our end. There is a good chance that the problem that you are facing now could be possible because of these changes made.\"  So now I have to wipe the computer and return it with the prepaid label they are sending. Amazon is refunding the extra protection policy I purchased.  In addition, HP stated that I had 336 days left on my warranty even though I only had the computer for 7 days. Evidently, the seller must purchase them to upgrade and then resells them - creating the gap in the time expired from warranty duration. One more tip, HP agent said I could get a copy of the transcript after I close the chat... but don't close it yet, there's another button to push for transcript first before closing the chat.  This has been a totally frustrating experience and the seller should not upgrade unless more RAM is purchased. BUYER BEWARE!UPDATE: Returned laptop and got a notice about the refund and was glad until I saw the amount was over $130 LESS than what I paid. After contacting Amazon, they said the seller charged a restocking fee! I explained the entire situation and they reached out to the seller. The seller's reply: \"In accordance with Amazon policies, we typically charge a restocking fee for used items or those damaged by customers. After reviewing your return reason, we have decided to trust your explanation and issue a full refund.\" The refund is labeled \"Goodwill Refund\". It is still about $8. short. I'm tired of fighting this battle. Where is the accountability for creating this problem? I have since purchased a new laptop through Microcenter and have purchased their Priority Plus plan which is worth its weight in gold. I can call up at anytime and they will remotely address any issues on my laptop.",

      "reviewDescription": "Just what I was looking for: a light-weight HP laptop that has Microsoft lifetime non-subscription,  upgraded features. I've been satisfactorily using Windows 10 on two 17-inch laptops (an HP and a Lenovo) for several years. But when Microsoft announced not supporting WIN 10 and encouraging the installation of WIN 11, I knew I would have to \"bite the bullet\" and upgrade before I ended up having to buy Windows 11. WIN 11 comes pre-installed. I've become accustomed to using Office suites since the mid-90s (okay, okay I'm now 78).  Free pre-installation of the latest of the non-subscription Office suites (2024) was a big plus when considering the purchase of this new laptop.  I hope I'm all set for the rest of my life.  I was also looking for a laptop that--as I age--I could much more easily carry around the house than I can right now carry my 17-inchers.  (It could also be easier to carry when I pack up other personals if ever notified to evacuate due to fire, wind, or earthquake.) Also, realizing that I didn't necessarily need a 17-inch laptop any longer, I chose a less expensive 15-incher. By the way, validating the pre-installed Office 2019 is easy. Just don't hurry, read everything on the screen as you work toward validation, and you'll be done with that step in four minutes! Watch that you do not install Microsoft 365 'cause you'll have to pay for and subscribe to it. If you don't need it, then Office is truly adequate for you. The legal pre-installed version of Office 2019 is genuine Microsoft software that does not come with a product key and, therefore, it does not need to be registered with Microsoft.  (If you have an online Microsoft account, it's up to you if you want to register the laptop itself.)  One more thing, once you're done with setup process, you'll notice that OneDrive is the default for synchronizing. If you're not familiar with OneDrive, go online to understand what it's for and how it works. Contact the seller via Amazon's communication feature for anything. Just click his name on the right side of the product description page and you'll arrive at the seller's profile with the link for communication in the upper right corner.",

      "reviewTitle": "Powerful and Reliable – A Great Value for Serious Gamers",
      "reviewDescription": "As someone who’s been building and using gaming PCs for years, I picked up the MSI Katana 15 HX B14WGK-016US primarily for portability without compromising performance—and I’m impressed with what this system delivers.First off, the Core i9-14900HX and RTX 5070 combo is no joke. This laptop chews through modern AAA titles without breaking a sweat. I’m seeing 100+ FPS on high to ultra settings in titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Hogwarts Legacy, and Call of Duty MW3, and it stays consistent even during long sessions. MSI did a solid job with thermals—kick on Cooler Boost and it stays cool enough without thermal throttling. The 165Hz display really helps the experience feel fluid in competitive titles.Stability is another strong point. No weird crashes, no blue screens, no random freezes—just reliable, smooth performance. And coming from a brand like MSI, that doesn’t surprise me. I’ve used their graphics cards and motherboards in my builds for years, and they’ve always delivered.  MSI overall I’ve had a good experience with their products That same engineering shows up in this laptop.That said, there are some things to be aware of. Battery life isn’t great—maybe 4 hours max under light use, and much less if you’re doing anything demanding. For some this laptop could be heavy for a 15-inch laptop, but others will say its not. I didn’t pick this laptop for its light weight design. It was about performance and portability. The chassis is plastic but metal feel and pretty basic clean design, though it feels solid enough. The RGB keyboard looks great, but the number pad layout is cramped and takes getting used to.Out of the box, expect sometime to setup— Windows updates, and drivers, etc.Bottom line: if you’re a gamer who prioritizes performance and value, this is a fantastic machine for the price. You’re getting high-end GPU and CPU power without paying $2K+. It's not a luxury laptop—it’s a focused, performance-driven tool for gaming and heavy workloads. Highly recommend for experienced users who want desktop-like power in a mobile form.",

      "reviewDescription": "This one takes the cake. During the fourth of July sales going around from every major tech market, I did about two weeks of research only to come to terms that this was not only one of the cheapest options, but best priced options for everything that's attached to the motherboard. I was pleasantly surprised when I fired everything up and ran a few benchmarks to see just how well it did right out of the gate. Note, this is all without anything overclocked here. I mainly wanted to do some benchmarks without any tampering just to see how it ran. Here is my results;Superposition benchmark - average 80 frames (Could of been higher if frame gen was included but not too bad)Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark - average 124 frames (Ultra settings maxed, excluding a few ray tracing options)Path of Exile 2 End Game maps - average 80 frames (High settings, Frame gen hasn't been optimized in path yet, but runs amazingly well)Hogwarts Legacy  benchmark - average 100 frames (Ultra settings, frame gen has slight stutter frames but runs exceptionally well)Pros:- Runs games exceptionally well- Price is possibly the best for what you're getting- Though not OLED, the picture quality is very good- MSI and it's features are nice if you haven't tried them yet- Sleek and incredibly designCons:- Is quite noisy- Does run a little hot, might consider a cooling pad for better heal levels in peak moments- 1TB might not be enough if you're a serious gamerAll in all, its an incredible laptop for what you're getting. I'm thoroughly enjoying everything that it has offered thus far. All that's left is to focus overclocking and pushing it to the limit.",

      "reviewTitle": "Nice Computer - Dangerous Charger/Battery",
      "reviewDescription": "I used to like Acer:I received the laptop a few days ago.  I followed the very sparse getting started instructions and plugged the charging cord into the Aspire GO 15 laptop and then into the wall socket.  Immediately, upon plugging in, sparks and FIRE shot out of the electrical socket I plugged it into & in the other sockets in the same room.  VERY DANGEROUS!!  I immediately unplugged it from the wall.The weird thing is the computer seems to work fine, I was able to set it up and set up my email account too. It seems that it was already fully charged when it arrived??  But, I'm pretty sure the fire and sparks caused damage to my electrical wiring. I'm afraid to use the electrical socket now, as it might cause a fire in the wall, if the wiring encasing has melted.I filled out the refund or return online form here at Amazon... two days in a row.  But, they are silent. The form says I need to erase any personal information before sending the computer back.  But, I don't know how long the computer will continue working without being charged and no one has offered to send me a label to send it back.  I've heard absolutely nothing from Amazon or Acer.So, I am inclined to just report this very dangerous product to the  \"Consumer Protective Safety Commission\". It could have very easily caused a fire or injured someone who was too near the socket.  I believe the battery and charger is from Thailand and they got it from China.  China has recently had some of their battery chargers recalled.  This one should be recalled too... in my opinion.",

      "reviewDescription": "This is a U.S. made laptop which while having all you might expect, and I have no complaints re the quality or performance the annoying / frustrating thing is that the keyboard is for the U.S. user and consequently there is no UK Pound key, it,s the $ key also the @ key for UK use is the exclamation mark key. That is when you switch the the UK key format which very frequently just reverts back to the U.S. mode !!!!I have tried to contact the ACER support service through the contacts provided but these turn out to be in Taiwan who replied in Chinese. Unfortunately since I am only a home use user I only started to find these problems after the Amazon return date . My next move is to contact Which Computer Services and see if they can sort the keyboard problem out for me. Lesson learned !!!",

      "reviewDescription": "For me, it's been a total game-changer because I just needed something simple and reliable for my everyday stuff. It's the perfect companion for managing my digital life without any of the usual hassle. Great replacement for my broken laptop.Honestly, it's been perfect for all my essentials—things like paying bills, catching up on emails, and just browsing the web. The thing is seriously fast; it boots up in just a few seconds and handles everything without a problem. And the best part? There's no junk software or bloatware to get in the way—just a clean, secure operating system that does what it's supposed to. It is Lenovo, which I also love.If you're like me and just want a no-fuss machine that's great at the basics, you've got to check this out. It's an amazing value and has really made my digital routine so much easier. I honestly can't recommend it enough!",

      "reviewTitle": "Great purchase!",
      "reviewDescription": "Nice Chromebook! I bought it for half the price as an Amazon Renewed item and it arrived in perfect condition and to my surprise it came in the original box (it was open but sealed with tape) so I assume someone bought it and maybe used it for like a couple of hours and said \"I don't like it\" or something.Pros: Huuuge screen, you can perfectly watch a movie or videos here and in good quality. The screen is not perfect but for this price it is awesome.- Battery: I've been using it for a couple of hours now with the full charge and so far with medium brightness settings it has consumed around 40% and I've been watching videos, browsing internet etc. OH btw it only took 1 hour or maybe less to fully charge it.- Numeric keyboard babyyy! Huge screen and great keyboard, keep in mind it's not backlighted so better look for a place with enough light to use it.- ChromeOS: This OS is packed with more than enough apps and features for a person who simply enjoys scrolling through the internet, read emails, check the weather and of course multimedia. If you're coming from Windows, don't give up on it trust me it is an awesome OS and you have embedded options such as Google Workspace and GDrive to carrry around your files not just on the laptop but on your cellphone, regardless of your phone OS (Android - iPhone)----------------------------Cons:This processor is a basic option to browse the web and basic stuff, heavy Android apps will probably experience lag, so beware that heavy apps may affect performance on the system. If you're planning on downloading games or something like that, maybe this is not your option.Screen isn't the best, some colors can look washed out... Remember you get what you paid for, if you want a better screen then you will probably have to spend a little more.",

      "reviewTitle": "Decent laptop",
      "reviewDescription": "Not sure why but I got this same laptop in September and it was not touch screen so when I purchased it again (after a cup of water mishap with the lap) I was surprised that it was a touchscreen after all. Touchscreen is very sensitive. Apps seem to have a hard time loading sometimes and Netflix will close itself out after a little while. I like how it does connect to your gmail, so all of my stuff from my other laptop was transferred over even the screen saver. I believe it’s a tad over priced for the quality of the laptop. It’s a good easy laptop for college students (that’s mostly what I use it for)The shipping for two days was crazy to be honest $80. So I payed a total of $400 for this laptop.I will say keep cups of any liquids away from it and make sure you clean your keypad of dust etc. My last one got a cup of water spilt on it and automatically fried with no chance of drying it out or saving it.",

      "reviewTitle": "BUYER BEWARE OF DELL, AMAZON AND THIRD PARTY SELLERS ON AMAZON!",
      "reviewDescription": "BUYER BEWARE OF DELL, AMAZON AND THIRD PARTY SELLERS ON AMAZON.  And extended warranty company Asurion.Amazon's  practice of listing and selling products like Dell computers for third party sellers seems like a scam, since the third party seller can sell old products on Amazon where the warranty is already expired or almost so.  And I saw nothing on AMAZON's site when I bought the DELL computer that things like an expired or limited time warranty could be an issue when buying ON AMAZON from a third party seller.Bought this Dell computer on Amazon, July 16, 2024, and Jan.3, 2025 the screen separated from the cover.  Contacted Dell, and they advised the WARRANTY was EXPIRED!  That's less than 6 months.  Dell said the AMAZON third party seller resold the computer on AMAZON months after it bought the computer, and the warranty began to run earlier when the third party seller bought the computer. Not when I purchased the computer on Amazon!Spent hours on the phone with Dell, and they know about this issue with third party sellers.  Even after providing them with the Amazon invoice and receipt of when I took possession of the computer, they would not help me and apply and run the warranty to the date I bought the computer from Amazon.Amazon's rep basically said sorry, but that's my problem for buying from a third party seller. Say what?  I bought the computer on AMAZON and paid AMAZON.  Now I'm out of luck?To make matters worse, I bought an extended warranty on Amazon from Asurion on the same day I bought the Dell computer on Amazon.  When I tried to make a claim, Asurion auto responded that the Dell computer still has the manufactures warranty and to contact Dell, seemingly as a result of only having purchased the computer from Amazon in July.  And not taking into account that the warranty started to run when the third party seller bought the computer months earlier.Shame on Dell, Amazon, and Asurion.",

This is what I use for work - create spreadsheets, Word docs, internet access, music,  create and cast simple presentations.  For these tasks this has been the perfect tool.  The build quality is great - the keyboard feels very good.  The camera quality has been great for video calls.The one knock, as has been said in other reviews, is the screen.  It is not amazing but it's clear and it works for what I use this for.  If this was my only computer and I wanted to watch movies on it often it would be a let down.  For streaming a game or video while at work - it's perfect.Overall, for the price this has been an amazing machine for my purposes.  It's a very capable machine but if it got smashed in my shop I won't cry about it.",

It's not super fast with heavy multitasking, but it handles the essentials just fine. Storage is a bit limited, but I use the cloud and haven't had any issues. Great option if you need something simple and affordable.",

      "reviewDescription": "HP 14 Laptop (14-dq0040nr) – Affordable and Portable, but with Some Trade-offs⭐ Rating: 4.0/5 ⭐Pros:✅ Affordable Price – This HP 14 laptop is budget-friendly, making it a great option for students, light users, or those in need of a secondary device.✅ Portable & Lightweight – The thin and lightweight design makes it easy to carry around, ideal for on-the-go use.✅ Decent Display – The 14-inch HD micro-edge display offers clear visuals, though it's not full HD.✅ Windows 11 Home – Comes with the latest OS, which is optimized for modern applications.✅ 1-Year Microsoft 365 Subscription – A great addition for users who rely on Word, Excel, and other Office tools.Cons:❌ Limited Performance – The Intel Celeron N4020 processor is okay for basic tasks like web browsing, email, and document editing, but struggles with multitasking or demanding applications.❌ Only 4GB RAM – The memory is quite low for modern standards, leading to slower performance when multiple tabs or applications are open.❌ Minimal Storage (64GB eMMC) – The storage space is extremely limited, meaning you'll need external storage or cloud solutions for larger files.❌ Not Ideal for Heavy Use – Not recommended for gaming, video editing, or other intensive tasks.❌ No Backlit Keyboard – Typing in low-light conditions can be challenging.Final Verdict:The HP 14 Laptop (14-dq0040nr) is a solid choice for those needing an affordable, portable device for light tasks like browsing, streaming, and office work. However, its limited RAM and storage make it less suitable for power users or heavy multitaskers. If you need a simple laptop for everyday use and don't mind relying on cloud storage, this could be a good pick—but if you need better performance, consider upgrading to a model with more RAM and SSD storage.",

      "reviewDescription": "I used this laptop for about six months. At first, it worked fine — good enough for basic tasks like typing documents, checking or sending emails, reading the news, and browsing social media. It served well as a simple “typewriter” and basic communication tool.However, after six months, it started slowing down noticeably. The biggest issue appeared when typing online — the system began to lag, even after I cleaned up unnecessary files. Sometimes it also takes a long time just to log in, which is frustrating.While it’s okay for light everyday use, this laptop is not well-suited for more demanding or creative tasks, like video editing or content creation.Overall, it’s acceptable for the price, but don’t expect long-term performance or power for serious work.",

I received a refund and then purchased this HP, I'm actually kind of glad the other one died lol it was sooo slow got really got when I used it and just was crappy!

      "reviewTitle": "AWESOME LIKE NEW COMPUTER!",
      "reviewDescription": "I hate that some people are having issues with these little computers but the one I received seems perfect. I've thoroughly inspected it and I've used it for several hours. It looks and works like new. I feel there is a distinct advantage to buying refurbished electronics like this. Someone bought it new and had problems with it so they returned it. The issues were resolved and it was sold to me. I now have a like new computer with all the problems worked out before I bought it at a great price. All my programs and apps loaded without any problems. Some seem to be receiving these computers without a power supply. Mine had one that was also in new condition. Would I like for the battery to last longer? Sure I would, but it lasts for several hours which is an acceptable amount of time and it recharges quickly. The screen is clear and sharp and the colors are excellent. The keyboard is also excellent with no \"sticky keys.\" I bought this computer with a 256 gig hard drive so it has a lot of space left after loading my programs and apps, and the 4 gigs of RAM makes the computer fast enough for my needs. I have not noticed any lag time. The fact that it came with the latest version of Windows preinstalled was a strong selling point for me. I love that it folds up to work much like a tablet if I want. It’s a bit heavier than I expected but that is not a deal breaker for me. In summation, I couldn't be happier with this computer. I highly recommend the refurbished Dell Latitude 3190 HD 2-in-1 for anyone who is looking for a computer that is small but still powerful and easy to use. For the price, it is a true bargain. I would definitely buy it again, and I would recommend it to my friends and family.",

      "reviewDescription": "I had originally purchased a chromebook for college, but one of my labs required the desktop version of Excel. This was a quick replacement, but it's been surprisingly nice! The touchpad is responsive, the computer is easy to fold into the tablet and makes it good when sometimes you want something to carry around. The laptop is really lightweight though, basically takes up very little room in my backpack. It's not a supercomputer, it's meant to be a nice laptop for watching things on, writing papers, and sending e-mails– I imagine some reviews will comment on this already, but this is not something you play games on. I'm surprised at how cheap it is though for how nice it's been! my only issue is that I peeled off the sticker for the mousepad and that unintentionally took off some of the coating, but it hasn't caused me any issues, just a cosmetic t hi ng.",

      "reviewDescription": "I generally liked this laptop and would have rated in the 3 - 4 star range.  There are not many options out there for a 17\" screen laptop at reasonable prices and this one seemed like a good choice.  Unfortunately, it had a severe problem maintaining connectivity to my wifi network.  It seemed like on every click on a link to connect to a website, it failed to do so and I had to go through all the steps to re-establish connectivity.  I tried it for several days and spent hours hoping that the problem would subside.  I also tried turning off the power management feature that would turn off the wifi connection, switched between the private network - public network choices, and checked to make sure I had the latest driver for the chip.  Nothing worked.If you surf the net and even in the Amazon reviews for this model laptop, you will find that network connectivity is not a strong suit of HP.  I knew that before making the purchase.  I also saw that a significant majority of the reviews on this site for this laptop were positive.  So I decided to take a chance.  It did not work out for me.  I considered getting an identical replacement but, in the end, I bought another laptop from a different manufacturer.  The new laptop, being used in the same spot as the HP, has had no problems with wifi connectivity.In summary, the HP laptop seemed like a good machine and would have satisfied my requirements.  However, without consistent wifi connectivity it was totally unacceptable to me.",

      "reviewDescription": "I've been watching this monitor on Amazon looking for a sale. Then one day it was priced $155.24. I couldn't believe it. I ordered it only to find it was not packaged in a Dell box. It was warranted by Amazon. Probably a return or something. I connected it up and it worked perfectly. Superb picture but the sound was rather tinny but definitely adequate, OK for voice but if you want quality sound there is a port on the monitor to connect your own powered speakers. The quality of the picture was what I wanted. I wanted sound but it wasn't important that it be high fidelity. I got a great deal and I'm very happy with it. I bought a HDMI 2.1 cable for it. It came with a cable for a laptop which I didn't use. It was super easy to assemble the stand and it is very stable. Easily adjusts to portrait position. Highly recommended.",

I stream the games from my laptop (across the room on my desk) to my giant TV and use a big hard mouse pad while laying on my bed and its like. I feel like. These are the moments where you realize life is kinda awesome and you can totally play computer games whole laying down in bed and ok I sound lazy in this i get it, but actually,  no , I work 70 hours a week ok, sometimes 75, I worked 9:45 today so alright. You can judge me because I want to play idle miner with one hand while eating a snickers ice cream bar with the other. Its ok, I don't do it for anyone else but me.This product is good.",

      "reviewDescription": "I got the upgraded Aspire 3 15 with touchscreen and updated AMD hardware with Ryzen 5 and Radeon graphics and 512GB SSD. I must say, I absolutely love this laptop. Now I know its not the fastest, thinnest, widest, longest lasting laptop in the world, but by god it comes close. I love how everything work on it, and the thing is its a great ALL AROUND COMPUTER! Good for business, family, games, etc.The only cons that I think it has is the light duty speakers that it comes with, i feel they dont get very loud; but keep in mind im actually partially Def  too so that probably doesnt help. And one other thing is the battery life. I feel the battery life won't win any awards for longest charge, but I do feel that it does pretty darn good i think it gets anywhere from 6 to 8 hours a charge depending on your settings and use. Keep in mind, I also have my battery limited to 70% currently to help preserve my battery life, and also with my needs i feel this lapto suites me quite well! Because it does everything I need it to do and lasts just long enough for any of my wireless traveling needs.Great all around laptop though, especially being that I got it for just over a decent $400 bucks!",

She plays Sims 4 on it and some other smaller game. It's a pretty snappy laptop. Not very heavy. Does get pretty hot underneath after a bit of use but definitely worth what u pay.",

      "reviewDescription": "I did some research a few laptops that weren't going to break the bank and this one had everything I wanted plus the reviews were alright. This was really easy to set up. After I signed into my Microsoft account it transferred all of my bookmarks over to this new laptop which was a real help. I just use the laptop to read blogs, write reviews, scroll social media and email. I don't play games or anything like that and so far, this laptop has been great. I've had it for 2 weeks and haven't had a problem at all.I run the laptop at home for about 7 hours a day. It is keeping cool, isn't lagging, is fast enough for me to do everything I need to, even when I have 20 tabs open.It only had 8GB of memory but that's what my old laptop had and it was enough for me. I do take pictures and download them to this laptop and there's more than enough storage to keep everything that I download. My old laptop lasted me 10 years and I never ran out of storage with the same amount of memory.",

      "reviewTitle": "Horrific Customer Service for Issues",
      "reviewDescription": "Bought this laptop last year and it works when it wants to, basically. I think maybe I must have gotten a faulty laptop, since the other reviews give this computer such high marks. That's fine but what's not fine is how Acer has handled this issue, repeatedly. It shouldn't take a year and some months to fix or at least accommodate your customers for a bad product. Chat support runs me in circles, e-mail support will just stop responding mid-way through investigation or conversation and never return, and calling the actual customer service line gets me nowhere. I had to pay money, actual money, to send in the laptop for repair and it came back with the same issues: Image burned into screen, webcam not working, touchscreen working intermittently. I told the man over the phone that it really did feel like they received the laptop, did a one-over, and sent it back without any true effort put into seeing if it functioned or not. I asked them for a partial refund--not even a full refund, because I still use the laptop and it still works in other areas: good battery life, good wifi-connection, etc. But no, they wanted me to pay money, again, to have it sent in again. They wanted me to send a video of the burned screen through e-mail as well. ...?? It just all felt shady and ridiculous. There was no e-mail for me to send it to, even though the guy told me he would e-mail me so I could reply with the video. Acer's inability to assist with something this simple is just laughable. I hate to be that person but this is the last time I'll ever deal with customer service that bad from this brand. If this is how they treat issues, then I'll avoid 'Acer' on any products from now on.",

      "reviewDescription": "I am not sure where the negative comments come from. I purchased 2 of these laptops. My wife needed a new one also. I bought the R7 5825U Non-Touch screen. They were delivered quickly and safely. Both laptops powered on and went right to the update screen. Updated without issues. I took the time to remove/delete programs and apps that I will never use or were useless to me. I uploaded programs I do use without an issue, including LibreOffice. There was no blocking of the upload and the programs work as advertised. I am having no issues with fan noise/constant running. I hooked up to my WIFI easily and my DL/UL speeds are great.The laptops are very smooth running. They are quick and responsive.I would recommend these to anyone who wants a reasonable priced, every day, normal use computer.",

      "reviewDescription": "I've only had this computer for a few days, but so far it does everything I need.  Right now I'm really only using it for taking online classes, so I don't have any idea how it would perform for games or streaming.  I like the look - very classy.  I'd rather it had either DVI or DisplayPort outputs, but I had to buy a monitor anyway, so I bought one with an HDMI output.  I like that it has 6 USB ports, but I don't like that 4 of them are in the front behind a flap.  I don't really like leaving things plugged in to the front, although it is more convenient for things that aren't plugged in very long, like charging phones or headphones, etc.  I'm not sure how much storage I'll need, but the 250GB SSD seems fine for now, and hard drives aren't too expensive so I can add one later if I need to.  As long as it doesn't take a dump on me I think I'll be pretty happy with it for the foreseeable future.",

      "reviewDescription": "I needed a replacement for my aging desktop, and I already have a Lenovo tablet that I love, so I decided to go with this desktop. I needed a desktop with a solid state drive, that could do some medium-resolution image editing and light gaming (I play mostly older games). This desktop does everything I needed it to! It even runs some games that I didn't think it would be able to handle. It is also extremely quiet, and almost half the size of my old desktop. I love it!There are a few small downsides though. The solid state drive only has 256 GB of space. I wish it had more space. For now it's okay, it just means I can't install very many games at once. Also, it has 8 GB of RAM, but 2 GB are always reserved for the onboard graphics processor. So effectively it has 6 GB of system RAM. It is upgradable to 16 GB though, and I think I will be upgrading to that soon. I also wish it had more USB slots in the back. It has 2 in the back, and 4 on the front. I would have preferred it the other way around.Overall I am very happy with this desktop!",

We had to buy a second tower because this was all taking SO LONG that our personal businesses were suffering.We tried VERY hard to pursue a refund because we never want to deal with this product or customer service ever again but they refuse to give us one since the tower is now supposedly fixed. They did tell us they will extend the warranty for 3 extra months so hopefully if it's gunna crap out again, it'll do it soon.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. DO NOT WATSE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.

      "reviewDescription": "It is good enough for most small businesses and the speed doesn't disappoint for a workstation.It doesn't have a video card so I wouldn't recommend it to graphic designers unless you know how to install a video card.Windows 10 pro comes with encryption which should keep everyone out but Microsoft.  The m.2 solid state drive is a great value in this package.It comes out of the box as a feasible workstation, with limited bloatware and windows 10's usual desire to make sure they can take all of your data and use it for whatever they want.  Outside of running windows 10 though, this machine is great.Most professional businesses still want to use windows 7 as the time spent keeping your machine from spying on you legally is borderline not worthwhile (a wonderful feature of windows 10).Still though, as long as you know what you're doing and double check the settings after every major update to protect yourself from microsoft and additionally aren't under constant virtual attack by competitors trying to steal your trade secrets, this is probably just fine for small to mid sized businesses outside of the tech fields.This also doesn't come with office, so keep that in mind, but other than your business' specific software which wouldn't come on it anyway, you probably won't need anything else.I'll lower the stars if I run into any major issues but as long as it keeps running for 4 or 5 years I'll be happy with my purchase.",

Works well so far.  Long battery life. Mine is the 16 RAM, 1 TB SSD, vendor PDI Mobile. Latest OS Sequoia 15.5 (not the older Ventura like it said online) and now updated to 15.6. The keyboard looks brand new, no worn-out keys. The display is like new, no blemishes or scratches.  Both USB-C ports have a good grip.  Not a touch screen.",

      "reviewDescription": "I purchased this MacBook Air on August 15, 2025, and it arrived in excellent “premium” condition. For being a 5-year-old laptop, it’s still holding up incredibly well. I bought it as I was starting my freshman year of college and needed a powerful, reliable device.Previously, I was using a Dell Latitude E7440 from 2013, which was really showing its age—still running Windows 10 with poor audio quality, outdated graphics, and overall performance issues. Upgrading to this MacBook Air has been a huge step up in every way.The M1 chip may not be the newest anymore, but it runs beautifully for my needs. The only feature I wish this generation had is a touchscreen, but honestly, that’s a small tradeoff considering how much of an upgrade this has been.My only real complaint is that the screen tends to pick up everything—lint, dust, fingerprints, and smudges—but aside from that, I’ve been extremely happy with it. The build quality, performance, and overall premium Apple experience make this laptop well worth it.Key Points for Buyers:- Space Gray color was correct- Portability is on point with the 13-inch display size- Doesn't heat up like my older laptop, and doesn't have loud, noisy fans- 16GB RAM & 1TB SSD Storage- All the right USB ports!",

      "reviewDescription": "This is one of the best laptops I can recommend. Its Great thats really all there is to say. I use this for mainly multi-media purposes. It is great at that. The M1 chip is a beast, needs no fans, and CAN do mild gaming.  It sounds good and the picture quality of the display is what you'd expect; very good. Obviously since it's a mac its easy to use, and made well as it is solid aluminum. A timeless design. Its got basically a 500gb SSD so its got decent storage and its fast, but I also use a samsung usb type c flash drive thing for most my media to not max it out instantly. I really do like the track pad too, I normally am very picky about them and don't like most very much at all. However I have always liked the mac ones, and this is not exception is as really responsive and a good size. I got mine for around $700 or so and I could not love it more. I have it for over a year and a half with no issues!FYI there is only 2 type c ports and 1 headphone jack on this laptop",

Ya he tenido varias macbook y por experiencia puedo decir que esta en perfectas condiciones, me llegó sin rayones, la pantalla, bocinas, wifi, camara, todo funciona a la perfección, llego con MacOs sonoma 14.5 y la actualicé sin problemas, viene con un cargador generico de 65W, se agradece y se entiende ya que es un equipo reacondicionado, por lo general son los que la gente devuelve y al devolver a apple solo te reciben la laptop sin cargador, así que el hecho de incluir uno se agradece. En los comentarios vi que algunos usuarios les llego con mas del 90% de bateria, en mi caso llego con 87% y poco mas de 100 ciclos de carga, en México en iShop las venden nuevas de paquete sellado en menos de lo que me costó esta, sin embargo es al contado y preferí comprarla aquí a MSI. Lo menciono para quien la quiera comprar, quizá le convenga comprarla nueva. Fuera de eso todo excelente, muy contento!",

      "reviewDescription": "Let me begin by saying I purchased this 128gb 8gb Memory 2020 M1 MacBook Air from MOBILESUPPLY, as Refurbished - Acceptable condition. Total purchase price was 358.00 after tax and shipping. I had placed the order late Wednesday Evening and received my MacBook Friday Afternoon, The seller overnighted my MacBook to me (Kudos to MOBILESUPPLY for the fast shipping). The MacBook I received is in almost near mint condition with only two very tiny nicks, and a small smudge on the lid of the MacBook. It did come with a generic charger but I have an extra Apple branded charger lying around so I use that instead.This thing is really fast and I love the convenience of the Apple ecosystem. It's so nice to answer calls, and read/write text messages all from my MacBook, not to mention how light the MacBook is. 128gb Storage is a little on the lower end of things, however I use an Samsung 1tb External SSD and that solves that problem. Be assured for regular use 8gb of system memory is more than enough to serve your needs. I bought Acceptable condition as a baseline knowing that I would at least receive a decent MacBook, but that there is a possibility of getting lucky and receiving a much better condition one. If you're on the fence about purchasing a refurbished MacBook just take the plunge and buy it. Lastly be sure to research and review your seller prior to purchasing. Thanks for your time in reading my review.",

      "reviewDescription": "I'm so pleased with this Macbook Air M1 with 8gb RAM and 128gb SSD. I was worried about buying refurbished and my budget is tight so I went with the \"acceptable\" condition. Also, I was worried 128gb would not be enough storage but my last computer was a 2015 Macbook Pro with the same amount of internal memory. So, I've learned to use SSDs and iCloud.It arrived in great condition! It is incredibly fast due to the M1 chip, looks so beautiful and battery life is 88%! It can last an entire day, 14 hours at work. Does not overheat. The screen looks amazing. It's far, far more than expected and it's helping the environment too! I'm much less stressed about using this computer which fits in my budget (about $350) than I would be buying a more expensive version. Makes me hesitate to buy new when there are refurbished gems like this one! Thank you, Mobilesupply!As long as you are good with managing storage, I find the 128gb to be enough! Please make sure to check how much storage you are currently using prior to purchasing. Also, I received a non-OEM charger that didn't work so be aware of this as a possibility. The company gave me a small courtesy credit to buy a new one. Of course I wish it came with original Apple charger but still five stars!",

Upon arrival and inspection i notice that it has a bent in the back corner, obviously from a drop to the ground. This bend makes the screen not to be flushed when closing the laptop. So in my opinion it shouldnt be considered as an “excellent” conditions as drops with that force could have damaged something internally. Besides that the screen looks good and the scratches on the outside are not too bad, and the laptop seems to work fine. Battery is at 92% which is good. Will keep using the laptop as i need a computer right now. Will update if i notice anything else. Fast shipping.",

      "reviewDescription": "I recently purchased the Samsung 14\" Galaxy Chromebook and couldn’t be happier with my decision. As someone who isn’t very tech-savvy, I found this Chromebook incredibly simple to use right out of the box. The setup was straightforward, and navigating through apps and tasks is a breeze.One of the things I love most is how lightweight it is — perfect for travel or just carrying around the house. Whether I’m using it on the go or packing it in my bag for a trip, it doesn’t feel bulky at all.It’s also nicely priced for everything it offers. You get a sleek design, solid performance, and great portability without spending a fortune. If you're looking for something easy to use and dependable, I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook.",

It’s fast, reliable, and handles everyday tasks with ease. Pages load quickly, switching between apps is smooth, and Windows 11 runs without any hiccups.The build quality is ok, the full HD display looks great, and the backlit keyboard and fingerprint reader are nice premium touches you don’t usually get at this price. The 16GB of RAM and 1TB NVMe SSD make everything feel snappy, and WiFi/Bluetooth connectivity has been reliable.I wouldn’t recommend this for gaming or heavy video editing, but for browsing, emails, streaming, and basic productivity, it’s perfect — especially considering the value for the price. My family member has nothing but praise for it.✅ Pros:Fast performance for everyday tasksGreat value for the specsFHD display, backlit keyboard, and fingerprint readerPlenty of storage (1TB SSD)Reliable for web and email use❌ Cons:Not ideal for gaming or intensive workloadsOverall, if you need an affordable, dependable laptop for everyday use, this is a great buy!",

      "reviewDescription": "I recently purchased the Auusda T152A laptop, and overall, I’m impressed for the price. The Intel N95 processor, paired with 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD, handles multitasking and everyday tasks smoothly. The 15.6” Full HD IPS screen delivers vibrant colors and wide viewing angles, making it great for work and entertainment. I also appreciate the sleek design, backlit keyboard, and fingerprint reader for added convenience. Battery life is decent but not exceptional, and the mostly plastic build feels a bit flimsy compared to higher-end laptops. Overall, it’s a solid, budget-friendly choice for students, professionals, or anyone looking for reliable everyday performance.",

      "reviewDescription": "Bought as Prime day item.  Great graphics, superb storage, backlit keyboard appreciated, seamless Bluetooth.  All in all excellent value for the package compared to other name brands.  Also very good design and easy on the eye.  However, could do with a couple more USB ports and the audio would have been excellent if the speakers worked correctly, then disappeared entirely, could only use Bluetooth.  Unable to reinstall from download.  Had an IT guy investigate and deemed a hardware failure.  Vendor offered a replacement, which I acccepted, shipping label supplied.  The customer support was excellent, timely response (by email) and always professional and courteous.  I asked for a modest upgrade because of the inconvenience, but allegedly was out 6f stock on next model up.  They did offer a reasonable discount, some vendors don't.  Awaiting replacement, I hope it lives up to the potential this item is fully capable of.  If audio had function properly would easily have been 5 stars.",

      "reviewDescription": "Overall the laptop is a decent pick for a smaller budget and the specs that it has are great but the specs it lists don’t make up the computer entirely. First off this laptop heats up very rapidly because of its processor being so cheap and the 16 gb of ram doesn’t make up for the processor either still making it slow for things on a higher end but still great for basic office work but do be aware of the battery life only being 2 hours and bumped up to about 2 hours and 30 minutes with all its battery saving effects on and due to that make sure you are close to a power outlet whenever you use this since it dies fast.",

      "reviewDescription": "I travel weekly for work, and this laptop has become my favorite travel buddy. Weighing just 3.7 LBS and as thin as a notebook, it slides easily into my backpack without adding bulk. The durable quality withstood a few accidental knocks, and the compact design fits perfectly on airplane tray tables. No more lugging around heavy gear.",
